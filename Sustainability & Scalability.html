        <h2>Sustainability and Scalability</h2>
        <h3>A COMBINED SELF-SUSTAINING MODEL</h3>
        <p>Within two years, Helim Changemaker’s combined model will be self-sufficient and profitable. The higher the
            initial investment, the greater the profits of the factory, and the greater the impact of the Academy. </p>
        <p><img src="Images/GreaterInvestment.png" class="ImplementationImage"> </p>
        <p>With current estimations, an initial investment of 28% on the factory will cover all operations and
            management costs of the both the factory and the academy by the end of the second year of the project. </p>
        <p><img src="Images/CombinedSelfsustaingraph.png" class="ImplementationImage"> </p>

        <p>That is, to meet the costs: make it sustainable. </p>

        <h4>However, that is just the beginning of what Helim Changemaker project can do.</h4>
        <h3>SCALABILITY</h3>
        <p>Helim’s potential for marginal profit is so large, that even the smallest increase on the initial factory
            investment already has large consequences. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A 32% initial investment the factory investment purchases 10 new computer stations, and
                doubles the amount of trainees by the end of Year 3. </li>
            <li> A 49% investment purchases a whole new ARC academy in a new location, meeting all the
                costs of infrastructure, equipment, staff and maintenance by the end of year 4.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>GROWTH AND INNOVATION</h3>
        <p>Helim Changemaker project is designed to accommodate growth over time and allow expansion of its
            impact on the people it serves. </p>
        <h4>Greater Results in Education and Capacity-Building</h4>
        <p><img src="Images/DarfurImage5.jpg" class="SustainableImage"> </p>
        <p>The initial number of 312 trainees per year with 10
            computers can easily increase with a growth in input of
            essential equipment. A simple formula shows ARC’s
            Academy potential for growth:</p>
        <p><img src="Images/SustainableEquatino.png" class="SustainableEquation"></p>
        <p>5 more computers acquired from a simple donation or a purchase with the factory’s revenue will allow the
            Academy to grow from 312 trainees to 468 per year, exponentially increasing the impact of the project and
            its impact on local capacity-building. </p>
        <p>This formula also allows for the implementation of ARC E-learning academies in other places in Darfur, as
            well as in other organizations’ humanitarian settings across the world. </p>

        <h3>BROADENING THE REACH: IMPACTING THE LARGER COMMUNITY </h3>
        <p><img src="Images/SustainableImage2.png" class="SustainableImage"> </p>
        <p>Nessa El-Kanz Academy’s impact will reach beyond its trainees. On Saturdays, the academy will turn into a
            center for the community. Every weekend, the Academy’s management will plan and execute activities of
            various types. This may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Children and youth computer skills workshops:
                training the younger tiers of the community</li>
            <li>Communication technology workshops: training
                individuals to use email, Facebook and other tools to stay
                in touch with loved ones far away. </li>
            <li>Cultural exchanges: building friendships, international communication
                and intercultural understanding through connecting young students in
                Sudan and the United States.</li>
        </ul>
