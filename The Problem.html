    <h2> The Problem </h2>

    <h3> Malnutrition </h3>

    <p> 20 million children will suffer from acute malnutrition this year. In Sudan only, 300,000
        children are experiencing life-threatening severe wasting. This year alone, ARC will treat
        5,100 suffering from severe and moderate acute malnutrition in Kalma Camp. </p>

    <p> Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTFs) could get these children through malnutrition.
        UNICEF anticipates purchasing 34,000 metric tons (MT) of peanut-based RUTFs during
        2014, but that is not nearly enough. </p>

    <p> The current supply of RUTF is not able to keep up with the huge and urgent demand. </p>

    <h3> Lack of Opportunity </h3>

    <p> Currently, the most profitable option for women in Kalma camp is manual brick-making.
        It involves mixing animal waste, dirt, and water by hand in 100+ degree weather. At
        best, a woman can make $2.00 per day with this job. </p>

    <p> Other jobs involve farming outside the camp, domestic work in the nearby city of Nyala,
        or as volunteer teaching assistants for small rations of food. However, all of these have
        involved high safety and security risks, including sexual assault. </p>

    <p> None of these are nearly enough for the women to support themselves or their families. </p>
