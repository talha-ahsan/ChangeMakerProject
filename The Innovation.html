    <h2> INNOVATION: The Business Model </h2>
    <p> Building capacity and providing income opportunities will help women
        support themselves and their families while restoring their dignity and
        self-sufficiency. </p>
    <h3> "RUTF" FACTORY </h3>
    <p> In partnership with the Peanut Butter Project (PBP),
        the Helim Changemaker Project will establish a factory
        to produce a peanut-based â€œReady-to-Use
        Therapeutic Food (RUTF) to combat Moderate and
        Severe Acute Malnutrition. </p>
    <p> Operating as a hybrid non-profit social enterprise, the
        earned income of the factory will directly support the
        ARC academy to make it sustainable in the long run. </p>
    <p> For this model, the factory provides employment and
        income to women and other actors across the supply
        chain. The income will allow an initial group of women
        to support themselves and their families. </p>
    <p> Factory workers will work in a safe and clean
        environment, earning a fair wage, and perform
        dignified work that is saving the lives of children,
        maybe even their own. </p>
    <h3> ARC'S E-LEARNING ACADEMY  </h3>
    <p> Through groundbreaking innovation, ARC will be the
        first organization to provide virtual and transformative
        eLearning training and capacity building to IDPs in
        Darfur. </p>
    <p> Through virtual modules and online courses
        accessible from a computer lab set up near Kalma
        Camp, women and other participants will receive
        training in areas such as basic literacy, computer
        skills, midwifery, community-health work, nutrition, and
        business entrepreneurship skills.</p>
    <p> A daycare center allows women students and factory
        workers to have their children in a safe environment
        while they learn or work.</p>
    <p> After training, the women will be able to use their new
        skills to support understaffed areas in the camp, and
        to improve the quality of their community while
        earning an income to support themselves and their
        families. </p>
