        <h2> INNOVATION: The Business Model </h2>
        <p> Building capacity and providing income opportunities will help women
            support themselves and their families while restoring their dignity and
            self-sufficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/Innovation1.jpg" class="innovation">
        </p>
        <p> In partnership with the Peanut Butter Project (PBP),
            the Helim Changemaker Project will establish a factory
            to produce a peanut-based “Ready-to-Use
            Therapeutic Food (RUTF) to combat Moderate and
            Severe Acute Malnutrition.
        </p>
        <p> Operating as a hybrid non-profit social enterprise, the
            earned income of the factory will directly support the
            ARC academy to make it sustainable in the long run.
        </p>
        <p> For this model, the factory provides employment and
            income to women and other actors across the supply
            chain. The income will allow an initial group of women
            to support themselves and their families.
        </p>
        <p> Factory workers will work in a safe and clean
            environment, earning a fair wage, and perform
            dignified work that is saving the lives of children,
            maybe even their own.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="Images/Innovation2.jpg" class="innovation">
        </p>
        <p> Through groundbreaking innovation, ARC will be the
            first organization to provide virtual and transformative
            eLearning training and capacity building to IDPs in
            Darfur.
        </p>
        <p> Through virtual modules and online courses
            accessible from a computer lab set up near Kalma
            Camp, women and other participants will receive
            training in areas such as basic literacy, computer
            skills, midwifery, community-health work, nutrition, and
            business entrepreneurship skills.
        </p>
        <p> A daycare center allows women students and factory
            workers to have their children in a safe environment
            while they learn or work.
        </p>
        <p> After training, the women will be able to use their new
            skills to support understaffed areas in the camp, and
            to improve the quality of their community while
            earning an income to support themselves and their
            families.
        </p>

        <h3>THE INNOVATION</h3>

        <h4>TRANSFORMATIVE EDUCATION</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> An eLearning platform that will enable greater availability of quality content that is easily

                outcomes and local employment opportunities
            </li>
            <li> An educational environment and experience that is co-created with the women learners,

                <li> Employment opportunities across the value chain that tackle poverty, underemployment, and
                    boredom in the camp settings
                </li>
                <li> Women working in the factory will be able support themselves and their families while producing
                    life-saving food for their children
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>COMBATING MALNUTRITION</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Local production of RUTFs increases the supply of this life-saving product, assisting UNICEF and
                     ARC to saving children’s lives
                </li>
                <li> Local factory production allows for the development of additional products to improve the health
                     of the population and additional income generation opportunities
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION OF RUTF, ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND EMPLOYMENT</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Current and future high demand for RUTFs will sustain the factory while providing meaningful
                     employment opportunities across the value chain
                </li>
                <li> This hybrid non-profit business model allows for sufficient earned income to support the eLearning
                     academy and is a scalable model for future expansion locally or for other ARC programs
                </li>
            </ul>
