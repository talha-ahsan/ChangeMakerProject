        <h2>INNOVATION</h2>

        <h3>THE BUSINESS MODEL</h3>

        <p> Building capacity and providing income opportunities will help women
            support themselves and their families while restoring their dignity and
            self-sufficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/Innovation1.jpg" class="innovation">
        </p>
        <p> In partnership with the Peanut Butter Project (PBP),
            the Helim Changemaker Project will establish a factory
            to produce a peanut-based “Ready-to-Use
            Therapeutic Food (RUTF) to combat Moderate and
            Severe Acute Malnutrition.
        </p>
        <p> Operating as a hybrid non-profit social enterprise, the
            earned income of the factory will directly support the
            ARC academy to make it sustainable in the long run.
        </p>
        <p> For this model, the factory provides employment and
            income to women and other actors across the supply
            chain. The income will allow an initial group of women
            to support themselves and their families.
        </p>
        <p> Factory workers will work in a safe and clean
            environment, earning a fair wage, and perform
            dignified work that is saving the lives of children,
            maybe even their own.
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="Images/Innovation2.jpg" class="innovation">
        </p>
        <p> Through groundbreaking innovation, ARC will be the
            first organization to provide virtual and transformative
            eLearning training and capacity building to IDPs in
            Darfur.
        </p>
        <p> Through virtual modules and online courses
            accessible from a computer lab set up near Kalma
            Camp, women and other participants will receive
            training in areas such as basic literacy, computer
            skills, midwifery, community-health work, nutrition, and
            business entrepreneurship skills.
        </p>
        <p> A daycare center allows women students and factory
            workers to have their children in a safe environment
            while they learn or work.
        </p>
        <p> After training, the women will be able to use their new
            skills to support understaffed areas in the camp, and
            to improve the quality of their community while
            earning an income to support themselves and their
            families.
        </p>

                    life-saving food for their children
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h4>COMBATING MALNUTRITION</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Local production of RUTFs increases the supply of this life-saving product, assisting UNICEF and
                     ARC to saving children’s lives
                </li>
                <li> Local factory production allows for the development of additional products to improve the health
                     of the population and additional income generation opportunities
                </li>
            </ul>

                     employment opportunities across the value chain
                </li>
                <li> This hybrid non-profit business model allows for sufficient earned income to support the eLearning
                     academy and is a scalable model for future expansion locally or for other ARC programs
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>READY-TO-USE THERAPEUTIC FOODS</h3>

        <h4>RUTFS: THE PENICILLIN OF THE FIGHT AGAINST MALNUTRITION</h4>

        <p>
            RUTFS have a proven nutritional formula to bring severely and moderately malnourished children quickly back
            from the edge of starvation. It addresses problems such as lack of access to clean water and allows for
            treatment outside of clinics or other health centers.
        </p>

        <h5>RUTFS:</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>Do not require preparation, water, or refrigeration</li>
            <li>Can be eaten straight from the package and stays fresh after
            opening</li>
            <li>Can be given to any child, even in the most advanced and severe
                stages of malnutrition, anywhere, and by anyone.</li>
            <li>Have a recovery rate from malnutrition of 95% compared to a
                25% to 40% rate for children who were treated using traditional
                hospital therapies</li>
            <li>Are credited with dramatically lowering child mortality rates
                during famines in Africa</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Under a regimen of RUTFs, a child can quickly gain weight and go from a near-death state to relative health
            in a month.</p>

        <p>They have significantly revolutionized the treatment of malnourished children.</p>

        <h3>ARC'S "NESSA EL-KANZ" E-LEARNING ACADEMY</h3>

        <h4>E-LEARNING: THE NEXT ERA OF CAPACITY BUILDING</h4>

        <p>Africa is positioned to leapfrog traditional education all together, as it has done by adopting
            mobile phones rather than first building out fixed telephone networks.</p>

        <p>A turning point has been reached in Africa where trends have made eLearning more feasible:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Reduced cost of computing devices
            </li>
            <li>Reduced power consumption of devices</li>
            <li>Availability of off-grid power</li>
            <li>Reduced need for expensive set up and management of servers,
                networking and data storage with Cloud computing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Books are:</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>Too expensive</li>
            <li>Heavy, difficult to transport</li>
            <li>Static content</li>
            <li>Cost has increased over time</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>eDevices are:</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>Less costly than books</li>
            <li>Thousands of books fit in one device</li>
            <li>Dynamic content</li>
            <li>Cost is decreasing dramatically</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>MEETING THE CHALLENGES OF E-LEARNING IN DARFUR</h3>

        <p>
            The difficult environmental conditions and the lack of stable electricity flow in Kalma Camp are not an
            impediment to Helim’s Changemaker Project.
