    <h2> The Challenge </h2>

    <p> How might we provide education and training to help the women of Kalma camp earn
        an income to support themselves and their children in a dignified and sustainable way? </p>

    <h2> The Problem </h2>

    <h3> Malnutrition </h3>

    <p> 20 million children will suffer from acute malnutrition this year. In Sudan only, 300,000
        children are experiencing life-threatening severe wasting. This year alone, ARC will treat
        5,100 suffering from severe and moderate acute malnutrition in Kalma Camp. </p>

    <p> Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Foods (RUTFs) could get these children through malnutrition.
        UNICEF anticipates purchasing 34,000 metric tons (MT) of peanut-based RUTFs during
        2014, but that is not nearly enough. </p>

    <p> The current supply of RUTF is not able to keep up with the huge and urgent demand. </p>

    <h3> Lack of Opportunity </h3>

    <p> Currently, the most profitable option for women in Kalma camp is manual brick-making.
        It involves mixing animal waste, dirt, and water by hand in 100+ degree weather. At
        best, a woman can make $2.00 per day with this job. </p>

    <p> Other jobs involve farming outside the camp, domestic work in the nearby city of Nyala,
        or as volunteer teaching assistants for small rations of food. However, all of these have
        involved high safety and security risks, including sexual assault. </p>

    <p> None of these are nearly enough for the women to support themselves or their families. </p>

    <h2>The Opportunity</h2>

    <p> THERE IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO USE PROVEN
        NUTRITION MODELS AND NEW FORMS OF CAPACITY
        BUILDING TO BOTH REDUCE INFANT SEVERE ACUTE
        MALNUTRITION AND EMPOWER WOMEN TO SUPPORT
        THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES... </p>

    <p> DELIVERING SCALE, DIGNITY, AND SELF SUFFICIENCY. </p>

    <p> We bring a network of proven producers of nutritional products for
        severely malnourished children, as well as the innovation in e-
        learning tools for training in various areas into a combined
        framework that delivers quality product to children in need,
        employment opportunities across the value chain, support to sustain
        an ARC-run virtual academy, and dignity and self-sufficiency. </p>

    <p> Every aspect has been built in consideration with the people who use
        it—from the original conversations that led to the project, to the
        factory that will produce the Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF),
        to the online courses that will be offered at the e-learning academy.
        This project interweaves various cross-cutting themes to deliver an
        innovative combined network of social enterprise and virtual capacity
        building that is right in line with ARC’s aspiration of being a leading
        21st century humanitarian organization. </p>

    <h2> The ChangeMaker Team </h2>

    <p> THROUGH CO-CREATION WITH THE WOMEN OF KALMA
        CAMP AND OTHER PARTNERS, WE WILL TACKLE MULTIPLE
        PROBLEMS WITH A SINGLE, MULTI-LAYERED, REALISTIC
        AND MEASURABLE APPROACH. </p>

    <p> We also gathered a team of expert organizations to put together
        such a model. </p>

    <p> Together we are able to combat some of the most daunting problems
        in Kalma camp, from malnutrition to lack of income-generation
        opportunities, while improving quality of living, helping women
        support themselves and their families, and assisting the restoration
        of their dignity and self-sufficiency. </p>

    <h2> The Goals </h2>

    <p> WE SET NEW PARADIGMS IN THE WAYS WE COMBAT
        CRITICAL PROBLEMS AND HELP CREATE NEW
        OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE WE SERVE IN KALMA CAMP </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Create a self-sustaining model combining social enterprise and
            capacity building.</li>
        <li>Reduce child malnutrition while creating opportunity for restoration of
            dignity and self-sufficiency through a co-creation approach.</li>
        <li>Tackle multiple problems with a combined approach supported by
            meaningful partnerships with expert organizations in various fields.</li>
        <li>Build capacity using technologically innovative tools to improve
            accessibility and reach of learning resources.</li>
        <li>Inspire donors to get involved and reduce severe acute malnutrition
            while creating income-generation and women empowerment
            opportunities.</li>
        <li>Lead the field through the construction of a scalable and replicable
            model for other organizations to use in their humanitarian settings.</li>
    </ul>
