    <h2>The Opportunity</h2>

    <p> THERE IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO USE PROVEN
        NUTRITION MODELS AND NEW FORMS OF CAPACITY
        BUILDING TO BOTH REDUCE INFANT SEVERE ACUTE
        MALNUTRITION AND EMPOWER WOMEN TO SUPPORT
        THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES... </p>

    <p> DELIVERING SCALE, DIGNITY, AND SELF SUFFICIENCY. </p>

    <p> We bring a network of proven producers of nutritional products for
        severely malnourished children, as well as the innovation in e-
        learning tools for training in various areas into a combined
        framework that delivers quality product to children in need,
        employment opportunities across the value chain, support to sustain
        an ARC-run virtual academy, and dignity and self-sufficiency. </p>

    <p> Every aspect has been built in consideration with the people who use
        it—from the original conversations that led to the project, to the
        factory that will produce the Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF),
        to the online courses that will be offered at the e-learning academy.
        This project interweaves various cross-cutting themes to deliver an
        innovative combined network of social enterprise and virtual capacity
        building that is right in line with ARC’s aspiration of being a leading
        21st century humanitarian organization. </p>
