<h1>The Opportunity</h1>
<p>THERE IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO USE PROVEN 

    NUTRITION MODELS AND NEW FORMS OF CAPACITYD

    BUILDING TO BOTH REDUCE INFANT SEVERE ACUTE 

    MALNUTRITION AND EMPOWER WOMEN TO SUPPORT 

    THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES...</p>
<p>DELIVERING SCALE, DIGNITY, AND SELF SUFFICIENCY. </p>

<p>We bring a network of proven producers of nutritional products for

    severely malnourished children, as well as the innovation in e-
    learning tools for training in various areas into a combined

    framework that delivers quality product to children in need,

    employment opportunities across the value chain, support to sustain

    an ARC-run virtual academy, and dignity and self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>Every aspect has been built in consideration with the people who use

    it—from the original conversations that led to the project, to the

    factory that will produce the Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF),

    to the online courses that will be offered at the e-learning academy.

    This project interweaves various cross-cutting themes to deliver an

    innovative combined network of social enterprise and virtual capacity

    building that is right in line with ARC’s aspiration of being a leading

    21st century humanitarian organization.</p>
