        <h2>The Opportunity</h2>

        <p> THERE IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO USE PROVEN
            NUTRITION MODELS AND NEW FORMS OF CAPACITY
            BUILDING TO BOTH REDUCE INFANT SEVERE ACUTE
            MALNUTRITION AND EMPOWER WOMEN TO SUPPORT
            THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES... </p>

        <p> DELIVERING SCALE, DIGNITY, AND SELF SUFFICIENCY. </p>

        <p> We bring a network of proven producers of nutritional products for
            severely malnourished children, as well as the innovation in e-
            learning tools for training in various areas into a combined
            framework that delivers quality product to children in need,
            employment opportunities across the value chain, support to sustain
            an ARC-run virtual academy, and dignity and self-sufficiency. </p>

        <p> Every aspect has been built in consideration with the people who use
            it—from the original conversations that led to the project, to the
            factory that will produce the Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF),
            to the online courses that will be offered at the e-learning academy.
            This project interweaves various cross-cutting themes to deliver an
            innovative combined network of social enterprise and virtual capacity
            building that is right in line with ARC’s aspiration of being a leading
            21st century humanitarian organization. </p>
